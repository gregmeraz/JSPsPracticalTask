JSPs course practical task

NOTES ON THE TASK: 
You need to add servlet-api.jar in order for your project to work, you can do this by manually adding the jar to the class path of the project 
or you can use a dependency management tool like mvn or gradle.

Skeleton of the project was done by using xml based configuration, but you can change it to annotation based configuration if you feel confident about it.

This was done using tomcat 6, but you can use a newer version of tomcat if you wish.
